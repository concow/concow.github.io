So I've just completed my first project - the CLI Data Gem Project. My first thoughts immediately are that it was the best learning experience so far. Flatiron has provided a tremendous amount of content and resources on helping you, even for online students. I utilized them when necessary, as well as Google.

The coolest part was coming up with your own idea, and seeing it come to fruition. Reminding yourself that 'I can do this.'
There is probably some more refactoring and areas in my program that I can refine better, but ultimately that is a part of the learning experience.

The most enlightening part was overcoming the challenges. It may have been the most satisfying as well now that I think about it. The one major hurdle was near the beginning when I was attempting to scrape this website but the HTML was tagged a bit strange which made it difficult for me to grab the data that I wanted. Ultimately I found a similar website (with cleaner HTML) and used that. After that the momentum kept on rolling and I near finished.

It was a nice relief and I'm looking forward to diving into the other curriculum.
