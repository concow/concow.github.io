Most times when you run into something you've done before it's a sigh of relief.
This is how I feel with the Object Orientation chapter in Ruby. Having learned OO in other languages, conceptually speaking, if you understand the moving parts of this structure of programming, it helps applying it to new languages you may learn in the future.

Don't get me wrong, it comes with it's challenges and I've certaintly faced my own and will continue to. But, when looking forward to landing a developer job, building your resume and portfolio - familiarity through the journey gives me a sense of comfort that a lot of us need along the way.
