I am a man of many interests. At a younger age, it was a difficult choice for me to decide on what 
career I wanted to pursue. First it was biology, than it was engineering, and finally I landed on
computer science.

I only started programming a little over a year ago. But I was interested in it well before that. After I took a couple 
classes in Java I felt that this was the right path for me on my future. I'm a creative person, with an abstract
way of thinking. Programming is an avenue that has allowed me to let those qualities flourish.

Most importantly I knew this would be a career that offered opportunities, and growth. In a lot of ways
I find this to be the beginning of a new journey for myself - and that leaves me with excitement.
