I've recently just surpassed a month at Flatiron. I feel like I have already learned a ton,
and still have a ways to go. I easily acheived the 100 lessons in a month challenge, 
which really boosted my confidence here.

One thing that I have enjoyed most getting a routine back in my life. I love structure and
working on this 5 days a week, 8 hours a day gives me the stability that helps me flourish as a person.

Most importantly I've thoroughly enjoyed the curriculum - the creativity, design, and
identifying similarities between one object oriented language to the next.

I look forward to keeping the pace I'm currently on, achieve my goal of completing the program before fall.
